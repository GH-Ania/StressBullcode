# StressBullcode

Thank you to Adafruit for the example of a basic code needed to use a force sensitive resistor. 
This code was found at https://learn.adafruit.com/force-sensitive-resistor-fsr

The 'pressure sensor' file combines Adafruit's basic force sensitive resisitor code 
and the Adafruit IO connection example from Nick's Dropbox (http://tinyurl.com/zjz2gcz)
